The cloud-native landscape is notoriously vast, and there is no hope of one human ever understanding every piece of it. Perhaps you should just quit now!

Or instead, join Matty and Whitney on a journey to discover how to level up your Kubernetes knowledge, regardless of different backgrounds, goals, and learning styles. They will share resources and learning strategies that are beneficial to each. Anecdotal stories about how some real-life Kubernetes community members got their start will be sprinkled in along the way!

The goal is not to give a comprehensive view of the Kubernetes learning landscape but instead to leave you feeling empowered to define your own personal learning strategies and goals, and then to seek out the resources that will best help you!
