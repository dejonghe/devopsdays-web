Managing a company’s infrastructure is a challenge of its own, so when you add scale, multiple DCs, complex deployments, and different stakeholders to the mix - It introduces bottlenecks and affects your ability to manage it effectively.

Infrastructure management is not only just about building the car- It’s also about changing the car’s wheel while it’s still on the move. So we need to have a proper mechanism and platform in place to support that.

In this talk, I’m going to showcase the Wix solution for an all-in-one dev portal, which was built on top of Spotify Backstage, where we’ve taken the programming lifecycle approach and applied it to infrastructure management as well.
It is utilized independently by over 200 developers and infrastructure personnel alike, and helped us manage over 15 datacenters in one codebase without compromising visibility and reliability.
